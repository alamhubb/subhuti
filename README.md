When you edit the middle part of the code, if you do not support fault tolerance, 
it will lead to exceptions in the bottom half of the code, such as unable to highlight, 
because the middle error, the following does not parse, so the need for fault tolerance


Why do you need a list of errors instead of parsing the errors directly, 
because you support fault tolerance, so there may be more than one error when parsing, and multiple errors will be provided
